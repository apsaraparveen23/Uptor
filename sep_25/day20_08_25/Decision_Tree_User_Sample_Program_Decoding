     No       Yes           No      Yes --------> Final Node (Leaf)

HyperParameter:

max_depth: Weather ---> Rainy ---> Pitch ---> Dry ---> Yes


Weather ----> Rainy
Rainy   ----> Pitch
Pitch   ----> Dry (YEs or No ) is Child node so it is now leaf

Now, we can see it is having 3 max_depth.

n_jobs = -1

-1 ---> Use all nodes of your system
1  ---> use only one core
2 ---> use two core

min_samples_leaf:

the number of final leaf each node should have

min_samples_leaf ---> it wil ony consider the node which has
minium 2 leaf results
