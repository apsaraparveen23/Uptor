Random forest is another supervised machine learning algorithm

Random forest algorithm can be used for 2 different type

Type-1:
    Random forest classifier
Type-2:
    Random forest regressor

Random forest algorithm is called as ensemble learning

Random forest is the combination of multiple decision tree and
each tree will have random subset of data.

Process of finding the random subset of data is called bootstrap sample

When to go for Random forest?
1. I want high accuracy of output
2. I don't want over fitting
3. Non linear data

Problems
1. little complex in structure
2. little slower in process

Analogy

Step-1: Packet full of fruits
Step-2: Apply random forest with 5 trees
Step-3:
    3.1 Tree 1 - Apple
    3.2 Tree 2 - Apple
    3.3 Tree 3 - Mango
    3.4 Tree 4 - Mango
    3.5 Tree 5 - Apple
Step-4: Final decision will be based on majority votes
Step-5: As per the above tree Apple is the final decision, because it has more votes.
