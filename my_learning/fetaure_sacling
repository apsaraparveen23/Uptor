🔍 What is StandardScaler() Doing?
The StandardScaler transforms your data so that:
- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1
This is called standardization.
It’s especially useful when features are on very different scales (e.g., price vs. carat size), and you want your model to treat them equally.

🧪 Example: Diamonds Dataset
Let’s say your dataset looks like this:
carat    price
0.5      1000
1.0      2000
1.5      1500
If you run a regression without scaling, the model might think price is more important just because its values are bigger.
After Standardization:
carat    price
0.5      -1.2
1.0     1.0
1.5      1.2

Now both features are on the same scale, and the model can learn true relationships, not just react to magnitude.

MinMax_Scaler:
- MinMaxScaler does not force the mean to 0 or the standard deviation to 1.
- After MinMax scaling, the 'price' values are compressed into the range [0, 1].
