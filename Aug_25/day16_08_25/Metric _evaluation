Types of Model:
1.Regression
    1.1 Metric evaluation:
       1.1.1 r2_score
             Expected value for the r2_score should be 0 to 1
             poor accuracy=0.01 to 0.75
             good accuracy=greater than 0.75
             over fitting=1.0
    1.1.2:mean_squared_error
          Expected value is as less as possible
       Note:This mean_squared_metrics cant be applied for all dataset
