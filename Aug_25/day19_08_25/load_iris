Load iris :

It is one of the data set which is available by default
inside scikit-learn library

Similar to load_iris, we have lot of other dataset as well.

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

Above line is to load that dataset in our program

usually we know we need two things

x and y

x  and y can be taken from this syntax

X = iris.data #this line will all the feature data
y = iris.target # this line will have target data

sepal_lenth  sepal_width petal_length petal_width   class
90              89          34          45          virginica
88              77          89          34          Versicolor
88              88          77          22          Setosa

Bascially:

Load_iris() is the dataset for classification.

Target is "versicolor", "virginica" and "setosa"

all three were types of flowers. So each flowers can be identified by using
four important feature

Feature is "sepal_length" "sepal_width" "petal_length" "petal_width"
