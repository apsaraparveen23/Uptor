In machine learning, outlier detection is the process of finding data points
that are significantly different from the majority of the data.
 These unusual points are called outliers.

Example:

Suppose you have students’ test scores: [35, 40, 38, 42, 95].
Here, 95 is much higher than the rest. It’s an outlier.


why outlier is important

Data quality – Outliers may come from errors (e.g., wrong entry, faulty sensor).

Model accuracy – Outliers can mislead machine learning models and reduce performance.

Insights – Sometimes outliers reveal rare but important events
 (like fraud in banking or a sudden disease in medical data).


Methods of Outlier Detection:

Statistical methods – Z-score, IQR (interquartile range).

Machine learning methods – Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, DBSCAN.

Visualization – Box plots, scatter plots help spot unusual values.
