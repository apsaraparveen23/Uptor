Differnce between isna and is null
both are functionally same

 is null--> command python created initially

 is na--> not avaailble.latest commamd used in python


 2 if their is empty data(like isna true),what is next step
 subjective- as appropriate,it can be dropped or filled.
 if we drop the data,the whole row will be dropped


 simple imputing:concept of filling the empty data
 it can be done through panndas scikit

 from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
 to run the above import u have to unstall the foll
 pip install scikit-learn

 si=SimpleImputer()
df['carat']=si.fit_transform(df[['carat']])
print(df)
above three lines will help us in filling cartat column with mean of the same column
Note:default filling of the simple imputer is mean

small filling data go to pandas
large filling of data go to simpleimputer(sckit)

big dataset=sckit(needed for pipe line mode
