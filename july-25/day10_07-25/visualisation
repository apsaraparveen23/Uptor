Visualisation is a concept of representing data in the form of graph
why -it is easier to understand thr graph view than the data view

Libraries for visualiation
1.matplotlib(primary)
2.seaborn(primary)
3.plotly
4.dash

Types of visual:
1.univariate
Only one colum is needed
2.bi variate
two col are  needed

Note:
*Generally graph used in visu is 2 Dimensional data
*Vis can be applied in any phase of model
*one of the preprocess concept of machine learning is EDA(exploratory  data analysis)
*EDA can be used for finding outliers(abnormal data)
and many more applications like this.
(Eg:extreme nos(unrealistic)while plotting graph can be easily seen thr graph)

Range for the data plotting in graph can be arrived thr different ways like percentile,quantile %
outliers are generally plotted thr box plot(which uses the above mathematical models)

Types of plot:
(applicable fo seaborn &matplotlib)
1.scatter plot(Nos vs no)
2.Box plot(univariate -numerical data)
3.Pie chart(numerical vs categorical-percentage based)
4.Bar plot( categorical-numerical)
5.Heat Map(Correlation-any column variants)(shows the relation ship between 2 features
if they are positively/negatively correlated thr color diff in heat map
dark colr-more correlated and vice versa
