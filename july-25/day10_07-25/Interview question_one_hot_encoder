One Hot encoder:
Player          Team
Dhoni           CSK
Kholi           RCB
Rohit           MI
Raina           CSK
Gill            GT

Under team,we have 4 categories(4 teams)
when we encode category to no the numbering  can be random

In one hot encoding -we get to number in a order

Label encoding(random no mapping while encoding)
Player          Team
Dhoni           0
Kholi           1
Rohit           2
Raina           0
Gill            3

One Hot encoding(retains the team column,creates new column for each category and binaries in it)

Player          Team   CSK   RCB   MI   GT
Dhoni           CSK    1     0     0    0
Kholi           RCB    0     1     0    0
Rohit           MI     0     0     1    0
Raina           CSK    1     0     0    0
Gill            GT     0     0     0    1

* Use Label Encoding only if the model understands ordinal features
 (like decision trees), or if the feature truly has order.
 Otherwise, go with One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
 like product types, locations, brands, etc.

If more rows .go for onr hot encodingusing sckit learn
for less rows we cam go for one hot encoding using pandas

In sckit we have a concept called pipe line concept
Pipeline-all functions of sckit can be grouped together
